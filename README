How to use:

1-			in main_all.c, change your .h path in the first include, to you ft_printf.h
2-			./Moumounator_printf.sh <../path_to_your_printf> (cspduixX%) (012)
				(sdiuxXp%) =	type to test
								Default: ALL
				(0,1,2) =	0 only display failed tests (Default)
							1 will both display failed and succeed tests
							2 same as 1 but detail for succeed tests
				No flag will test all type, with modified display 1.

			You MUST put a [0, 1, 2] flag, if you put a [sdiuxXp] flag.

			Go check flag_by_type.txt to see which types are tested with which flags.
			If you want to test all flags with all tests, change:
			#define ALLTEST 0
			to
			#define ALLTEST 1

BONUS:
			You can use the flag '-bonus' to toggle on bonus. It's must be the first arg after your path.
			You must have all green test of previous part. -bonus is a more advanced version.

			./Moumounator_printf.sh <../path_to_your_printf> -bonus -new
			Remove -new flag, to keep params of the last execute

			-bonus are not protected. Random answer will result random behavior.
